O2 Motion Code V1.0 :
In the first version of the code, I made the astronaut move (jump, duck, slide and dash).

02 Motion Code V1.1 :
In this version I refactored the code by creating functions for code in the animate function. The animate function handles key press events and calls the appropriate function associated with a certain key. In the previous version the animate function had the implementation of the functions which made it look overcrowded.

In this version I've also included more meaningful comments in the code.
