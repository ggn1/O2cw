# O2 - Every Breath Counts!

What is O2:
O2 is an online multiplayer game where gamers are part of a group of stranded astronauts on a hostile alien planet.
The game engages the gamers as they compete against each other's skill at surviving by dodging the many deadly
obstacles that the planet throws at them. Each obstacle that hits, eat away the player's health bar indicated by oxygen levels.
The game ends when a single player survives. This astronaut will reach home base and live to see another earth day.

Why:
This project, created as a part of our course work at university, aims at providing the user with a simple yet 
compelling group gaming experience.

How to get started on the unfortunate expedition:
Just download the zip file on this repository's master branch and open up the .html file on your favourite
browser and your good to go. All that's left to do now, is to hit play and wait a moment for other players to join
your team of explorers. Once the expedition team is set, its blastoff! 
Enjoy the adrenaline rush that accompanies the thrill of surviving against all odds.

(If you're just looking to tweak one of the best games out there and make it even better! Then just download the zip
file from the master branch and tinker away. You may be surprised how much you'll learn as you flex your coding muscles
and wrestle with some Html, CSS, js and NodeJs.

WARNING: We trust you will respect our efforts and not publish your tweaked versions of this game as your own. Such an act would be copyright infringement.)

instructions that you'll find at the bottom of the webpage.
